        </h4>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 cups shiitake mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 uncooked prepared meatloaf</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Stir in mushrooms and a pinch of salt; cook and stir until mushrooms begin to brown, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in fresh rosemary. Add flour and stir to coat the mushrooms; 
                cook and stir for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk in beef broth, 1/2 cup at a time, 
                whisking constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
            <li>Turn heat to high and bring the sauce to a simmer. Simmer a few minutes until sauce starts to thicken. 
                Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Slide prepared meatloaf into the sauce. Spoon sauce over the top of the meatloaf.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove pan from the oven and gently remove meatloaf to a serving platter.</li>
            <li>Skim off any extra fat from the surface of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat to reduce until thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
